# ü§ñ Model Setup Instructions

## üìã Overview

The ONNX model file (`asr_model.onnx`) is not included in this repository due to GitHub's 100MB file size limit. This file contains the optimized NVIDIA NeMo Hindi ASR model required for the application to function.

## üìä Model Details

- **Original Model**: `stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium` from NVIDIA NeMo
- **Optimized Format**: ONNX Runtime
- **File Size**: ~500MB (126.88 MB compressed)
- **Language**: Hindi
- **Architecture**: Conformer with CTC loss
- **Vocabulary**: 128 tokens (included in `model/vocab.txt`)

## üîß Setup Options

### Option 1: For Assignment Reviewers

**Contact Information:**
- **Repository Owner**: Samarth S Shetty
- **GitHub**: [@Samarth-S-Shetty](https://github.com/Samarth-S-Shetty)
- **Request**: Please contact for the `asr_model.onnx` file

**File Placement:**
```bash
# Place the downloaded file in the model directory
fastapi-nemo-asr/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ asr_model.onnx       # ‚Üê Place downloaded file here
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vocab.txt            # ‚úÖ Already included
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html           # ‚úÖ Already included
```

### Option 2: Download and Convert Original Model

If you want to recreate the ONNX model yourself:

```bash
# Install NVIDIA NeMo (large dependency)
pip install nemo-toolkit[asr]

# Download and convert the model (Python script)
python -c "
import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr

# Load the pre-trained model
model = nemo_asr.models.EncDecCTCModel.from_pretrained('stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium')

# Export to ONNX
model.export('model/asr_model.onnx')
print('Model exported to model/asr_model.onnx')
"
```

### Option 3: Alternative Implementation

Modify the code to use the original NeMo model directly:

```python
# In app/main.py or web_server.py, replace ONNX loading with:
import nemo.collections.asr as nemo_asr

# Load model directly
model = nemo_asr.models.EncDecCTCModel.from_pretrained('stt_hi_conformer_ctc_medium')

# Use model.transcribe() instead of ONNX inference
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

After placing the model file, verify the setup:

```bash
# Check file exists and size
ls -lh model/asr_model.onnx

# Expected output: ~500MB file

# Test the application
python web_server.py

# Test with sample audio
python test_client.py audio_files/Hindi_M_Devinder1.wav
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Model File Not Found
```
RuntimeError: ONNX model not found at model/asr_model.onnx
```
**Solution**: Ensure the `asr_model.onnx` file is placed in the `model/` directory.

### Model Loading Error
```
ONNXRuntimeError: Model loading failed
```
**Solution**: Verify the model file is not corrupted and is the correct ONNX format.

### Memory Issues
```
Out of memory error during model loading
```
**Solution**: Ensure you have at least 2GB of available RAM.
